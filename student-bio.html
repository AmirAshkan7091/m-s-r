            Hello, Welcome to my fisrt page.
            <br/> <br/>
            Lets talk about my self a little bit.
            <br/>

            My first name is Amir Ashkan and my last name is Salehian Dardashti.  

            I know that I have a long name but I am so proud of it, 
            
            because my first name has two-part, First is Arabic, which is Amir, and it means rulers or king. 
            
            Second one is Ashkan, that was the name of one of the Persian's empire that they lived between 247 BC – 224 ADS, so I think I should love it. 
            <br/>
            
            I used to play water polo professional around 13 years, and two more years for my national team.  
            <br/>
            <!--put a link-->
            I finished my associate degree in business administration back home, then I saw this is not that I want to do. 
            
            I would like to create something like music, movies, or sculpturing, so I saw Internet was the good place that allows me to keep in touch with people all around the world. 
            
            It has a same language, same form, same tools,
             also you would have your own style or be monopolized that people can understand who you are between all people that create something on the Internet for making people’s life easier.
            <br/>
             I am going to be one of the <a href="https://www.biographyonline.net/people/people-who-changed-world.html" target="-blank">people</a> that change the world.
